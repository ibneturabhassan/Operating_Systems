# Operating_Systems
This repository contains all the assignments that I performed related to Operating systems which include implementations of replacement algorithms, Inter Process communication, Shell scripts to perform basic operations.

# Parent_Child_Communication_using_Pipes.c
Design a simple C program using ordinary pipes in which a parent and child processes exchange greeting messages. For example, the parent process may send the message “Hello Child Process”, and the child process may return “Hi Parent Process”. Use UNIX pipes to write this program. For reference, see http://tldp.org/LDP/lpg/node11.html. Note that this URL only shows an example of a unidirectional pipe. You need to have bidirectional behavior in your program for which you will need two pipes.

# Print_Multiplication_Table_in_Shell
Write a shell script to print the multiplication table for the given number. You can take that number as input from the user.
